

1.You have to printa logic to perform all arthematic operations like add,sub,multi,division,%,//,**
a=int(input("enter the value:"))
b=int(input("enter the value:"))
c=a+b
d=a-b
e=a*b
f=a%b
g=a**b
h=a//b
print("adding of two numbers:",c)
print("substraction of two numbers:",d)
print("multiplication of two numbers:",e)
print("division of two numbers:",f)
print("power of two numbers:",g)
print("modules of two numbers:",h)

output::
C:\Users\Sobha\Desktop>bigg.py
enter the value:12
enter the value:13
adding of two numbers: 25
substraction of two numbers: -1
multiplication of two numbers: 156
division of two numbers: 12
power of two numbers: 106993205379072
modules of two numbers: 0


2.WAP biggest of two numbers?

a=int(input("enter the value of a:"))
b=int(input("enter the value of b:"))
if(a<b):
   print("b is biggest value then a")
else:
   print("a is biggest value then b")

output::
C:\Users\Sobha\Desktop>code.py
enter the value of a:21
enter the value of b:12
a is biggest value then b


3.WAP biggest of three numbers?

a=int(input("enter the value of a:"))
b=int(input("enter the value of b:"))
c=int(input("enter the value of c:"))
if(a<b):
   print("b is biggest value then a")
elif(a<c):
   print("c is biggest value then a")
else:
   print("a is biggest value then c")

output::
C:\Users\Sobha\Desktop>code.py
enter the value of a:21
enter the value of b:12
enter the value of c:10
a is biggest value then c

4.WAP generate numbers in given range?
